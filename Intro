MULTINOMIAL REGRESSION

The Multinominal regression is the supervised machine learning algorithm.
It is the predictive analysis technique where dependent variables are nominal more than 2.
Multinominal regression is used to determine the relationship between the 1 nominal dependent variable and one or more independent
Multinominal regression is the extension of logistic regression
In this type of model the output variabe is >2
No natural ordering in categories
Hence here will will apply for multi logits
